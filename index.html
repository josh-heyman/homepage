                            His passion and commitment for design has shone forth throughout his A levels and my visits
                            to the FutureTech building are always more interesting when Josh is in there; the spark in
                            his eyes when he starts discussing the current problem he is wrestling with is a wonderful
                            thing and shows that he is destined for a wonderful career in this field. Going from his
                            Herculean contributions in his group's Gold Award project last year through to his
                            groundbreaking final DT project, Josh has applied the Reed's values to his studies, his
                            hobbies and his every day conduct with aplomb and he should be exceedingly proud of

                            successes. Yet again this is a brilliant report with mainly "Excellent" for effort and this
                            has translated into an impressive set of academic grades. Achieving "9s" in both DT and
                            Computer Science at this stage is very impressive and it is great to see him continue these
                            topics into Sixth Form. Joshua is clearly an independent worker who is resilient in his
                            response to feedback. Outside of school it is great to hear about his golf successes and
                            swimming achievements. These are a huge part of what makes Joshua so broadly skilled. It has
                            been a privilege to be Joshua's tutor for the last two years and see him grow into a mature
                            young man.
